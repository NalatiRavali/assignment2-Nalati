###### Las Vegas  
Driving into the famous town of **Las Vegas**, you wouldn't imagine that you were about to enter a twenty-four hour party. But that's exactly what I was about to experience. As I crossed the dry Nevada desert and topped the last bare hill, I couldn't believe the sight that was right before my very eyes. Everywhere I looked I saw flashing fluorescent lights, buildings that seemed to touch the sky, people walking the entire length of the Vegas Strip, taxis and buses speeding and so much more. I really love in with this place.
